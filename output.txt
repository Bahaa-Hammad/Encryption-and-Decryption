The Gambler's Fallacy
If you flip a normal coin ten times, and you get ten heads, then
on the 11th flip, are you more likely to get a tail? Or, by playing
the lottery with the numbers 1 to 6, are you less likely to win than
playing with more evenly spaced numbers?
Don't be a victim of the gambler's fallacy. Past events never
affect the outcome of an independent event. Never. Ever. In a
truly random lottery drawing, the chances of any specific numbers
being chosen is the same as any other. There's no hidden law
that forces numbers that weren't frequently chosen in the past to
be chosen more often in the future.
