As discussed in Class:
Use the following Modular mode (k.P1+P2) mod (asci code book length) to encrypt a called word document using any programming language you choose.

A demonstration of the project will be set later on and will be done using Google Meet [date will be set later on], and each student will demonstrate the encryption and the decryption of the document using a selected prime numbers at the date of the demonstration, so make the P1 and P2 values easily added by the user.

Write a report on your findings, highlighting a sample screenshot of your code and the results,
